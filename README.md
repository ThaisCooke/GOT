It is no secret that I love "Game of Thrones"! When I first started learning SQL, I thought that a good way to learn would be to practice in something that I was 
interested at. 

Why not "Game of Thrones"?

There are so many characters, belonging to different regions, with different stories. I created this table from scratch, to practice some basic SQL skills. Feel free 
to copy and paste and practice yourself. I hope you enjoy it!

I also put the results in Tableau:
